# Machine Learning Engineer Certification Projects

Welcome to the Machine Learning Engineer Certification Projects repository! Here, you will find a collection of pilot projects and the final capstone project that were completed during my journey to become a certified Machine Learning Engineer. The projects are organized into week-by-week folders, each containing Google Colab notebooks or Python files that showcase the work accomplished during that particular week. Additionally, data used in these projects can be found in subfolders appropriately named "data."

Please note that this repository is a work in progress, and files are continually being uploaded to provide a comprehensive overview of the projects and the skills developed throughout the certification program. Feel free to explore the folders and files to gain insights into the various machine learning topics covered during the course.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Week X**: Each week is represented by a separate folder (e.g., Week 1, Week 2, etc.). Inside each week's folder, you'll find project-specific materials, code, and documentation.

- **data**: This subfolder contains the datasets used in the projects. You can explore the data to better understand the context and the challenges addressed in each project.

## Getting Started

To get started, simply navigate to the specific week's folder you're interested in and explore the associated materials. You'll find detailed documentation within each project to guide you through the code and methodologies used.

## Contribution

As this repository is continually evolving, contributions and improvements are welcome. If you have any suggestions, identified issues, or would like to contribute to a particular project, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

Thank you for visiting this repository, and I hope you find the projects insightful and valuable in your journey to becoming a machine learning expert.
